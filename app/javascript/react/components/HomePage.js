                Have you ever had a great idea for the beginning of a story, but didn't
                know where to go from there? Enter Works in Progress. Our goal is to
                provide creative minds with a space to explore, collaborate, and create
                in an open, friendly environment. Sometimes all you need is a little help
                from a friend to get you started on your next great work. Why not start
                your progress with us? Click the Prompts button up above and get started :)  -Jamie
